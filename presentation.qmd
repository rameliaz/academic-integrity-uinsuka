Say thanks

Explain my background. I'm a quantitative social psychologist but have a secondary interest in metascience which is the study of the scientific process to improve science, and it is also known as "research on research".

Retractions are almost always associated with scientific misconduct.

Some cases involves blatant scientific misconduct, including buying papers from paper mills.

Paper mill is a commercial entity that offers authorship for sale, fabricated peer-reviews, and other services.

## Do we have a scientific integrity crisis?

::: incremental 
::: {.smaller}
* We probably do, but the [massive underreporting]{.mark} and [lack of transparency]{.mark} in how institutions handle scientific misconduct cases make it difficult to fully understand the scale of the problem [@panelonscientificresponsibilityandtheconductofresearchMisconductScienceIncidence1992; @vieHowShouldResearchers2020].
* The most important feature of science is self-correction, and one valuable tool to do this is [post-publication review]{.mark}^1^ [@vazireWhereAreSelfCorrecting2022; @bordignonSelfcorrectionScienceComparative2020], but are we ready with this *yet*?
* We need more evidence for the scale of the severity, not just hearsay.
  * What about cases of scientific misconduct involving abuse of power?
  * Do we have a system that guarantees the safety of whistleblowers?

[RI^2^ Index](https://sites.aub.edu.lb/lmeho/ri2/map/) can help us guesstimate the *risk* of compromised scientific integrity, but not the *severity* of the problems.

## 'Bad Apples' or 'Bad Barrels'?

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}
::: incremental
::: {.smaller}

* It has been long argued that the crisis of scientific integrity in Indonesia is attributable to flawed moral characters of the perpetrators [@sandyPublishEarnIncentives2019; @hanamiQuestioningScientificPublications2023].
  * Individuals use the pressure to publish as a "scapegoat" to justify their unethical practices [@hanamiQuestioningScientificPublications2023].

* However, this is only one (unexhaustive) explanation.
* There are at least [six plausible explanations]{.mark} [@havenExplanationsResearchMisconduct2021] on why individuals engage in scientific misconduct, with different levels of analysis.
:::
:::
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
![](img/cartoon-1.jpg){width="100%"}
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
Attributing misconduct solely on individual behaviors neglects the social contexts where this behavior emerges, but stems from rather correct observations that severe sci misconduct are rare cases.

:::

## Plausible explanations [(Haven & van Woudenberg, 2021)]{.much-smaller}

**Individual level**

::: incremental 
::: {.smaller}
* [Rational Choice Theory]{.mark}: unethical decision making arises from cost-benefit calculation, where individuals are primarily motivated to maximize payoffs.
* [Bad Apples Theory]{.mark}: unethical individuals behave unethically because they have flawed moral characters.
* [General Strain Theory]{.mark}: unethical behaviors stem from maladaptive coping of extreme pressure/stress.
* [Prospect Theory]{.mark}: unethical behaviors stem from the fear of loss (jobs, incentives, etc.) than potential gain.

:::
:::

## Plausible explanations [(Haven & van Woudenberg, 2021)]{.much-smaller}

**Institutional and beyond**

::: incremental 
::: {.smaller}
* [Organizational Justice Theory]{.mark}
  * Individuals who perceive themselves to be treated **fairly** by their institution behave more fairly themselves.
  * However, if their institutions are perceived as being **unfair**, people are more likely to engage in unethical acts that make up for this perceived unfairness [@crainRelationshipsSurveyOrganizational2013; @gopalakrishnaPrevalenceQuestionableResearch2022].

* [Ethos of Public Administration]{.mark}
  * Individuals are seen to be isolated entity, while instutions can unify individuals into a single, efficient and rational working unit.
  * Individuals are lazy, selfish, and disinterested in institution's missions so institutional unity and discipline should always be maintained.
  * Extreme emphasis on effectiveness, efficiency, and quantitative outputs is at the expense of motivational crowding out (i.e., cobra effect, [Zein, 2018](@zeinEfekKobraDosen2018))

:::
:::

::: {.notes}
Organization unifies individuals through chain of command, a sense of mission, and hierarchical bureaucracies (e.g., IKU)

Academic misconduct is considered to be the logical behavioral consequence of output-oriented management practices, based on performance incentives --> university rankings, impact factors, citation count, n of pubs are more important than the credibility of scientific claims.
:::

## 'Bad Apples' or 'Bad Barrels'?

::: incremental 
::: {.smaller}
* It is more likely both.
* Accumulated evidence says that unethical behaviors should be approached from multiple layer of explanatory levels [@kish-gephartBadApplesBad2010].
* This aligns with evidence stating that professional stressors + low probability of misbehavior detection is a perfect recipe for scientific misconduct [@holtfreterPerceivedCausesResearch2020].
* In an unhealthy research ecosystem, scientific misconduct is perceived as having [a low (personal/professional) risk]{.mark}, but offering [high returns]{.mark}.

:::
:::

## Why Transparency?

::: incremental 
::: {.smaller}
* We need to shift the focus from [prestige to credibility]{.mark}, which can be achieved by making all stages of the scientific process transparent .
* What does transparency mean here? 
  * The audience receives sufficient information regarding [how all stages of research are documented]{.mark}, that they [can access]{.mark} these information without significant barriers, and that they are informed how to [interpret]{.mark} and [re-use]{.mark} research materials [@winkerEquityTransparencyAccountability2023].

* Transparency makes cheating [easier to detect]{.mark} and can [reduce ambiguity]{.mark} about what behaviors count as misconduct [@havenPromotingTrustResearch2022].
  * In the culture of transparency, scientific misconduct is harder to be justified as "everyone does it".
  * Scientists can feel more confident about their claims, signaling that they are ready for public scrutiny.

* At the end, we hope that transparency is embraced as a shared professional identity. 
  * In this sense, people avoid misconduct not because they fear of getting caught, but cheating is seen as incompatible with their professional identity.

:::
:::

::: {.notes}
Are these arguments just wishful thinking?
:::

## But, is transparency alone sufficient?

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
::: incremental 
::: {.smaller}
* Transparency can improve error/misconduct detection, but cannot act as deterrence.
  * Deterrence requires strong assumptions: that people *believe* that they *can* get caught and thus receive consequences/punishment from committing misconduct.
  * Some perpetrators don't see themselves doing anything wrong (i.e., 'normal misbehavior', [De Vries et al., 2006](@devriesNormalMisbehaviorScientists2006)).
  * Some people are more risk averse than others.

* Transparency without reforming how we assess 'research quality' won't fix perverse incentives problems.
* Imposing transparency standards (e.g., "open scientific practices") can add additional burdens to already overworked, underpaid researchers [@zeinOpenScienceCan2021].
* Transparency may increase credibility, but doesn't automatically guarantee quality [@vazireCredibilityReplicabilityImproving2022].

## Final Remarks

* We do have a crisis of scientific integrity in Indonesia, though the extent of the problem is not well known.
* This crisis is caused by both 'bad actors' and an unhealthy research ecosystem.
* Transparency may help us detect errors and fraud more easily, but it is insufficient as a deterrent.

::: {.notes}
To end this presentation, let me emphasize my key arguments.

I choose Latour seminal work here to highlight the fact that scientific process is a social process - we constantly navigate technical routines with external/interpersonal pressure.

Scientific misconduct here is a symptom of underlying unhealthy research ecosystem.
